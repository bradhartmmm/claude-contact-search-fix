## Background

This project started when Claude's native contact search began consistently timing out for users with normal-sized contact databases (1000+ contacts). The timeout issue made Claude's iMessage integration essentially unusable.

The solution bypasses the broken native search with a fast AppleScript implementation that integrates seamlessly with Claude's existing messaging tools.

## Technical Details

- **Backend:** AppleScript for direct Contacts.app integration
- **Framework:** Model Context Protocol (MCP) server
- **Platform:** macOS with Contacts.app
- **Performance:** <2 second search across 5,000+ contacts
- **Integration:** Works with existing Claude iMessage tools
