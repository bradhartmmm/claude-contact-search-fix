# Troubleshooting Guide

## ðŸš¨ Common Issues & Solutions

### "Tool not found" error
**Problem:** Claude says the contact search tool isn't available

**Solutions:**
1. Check Extensions menu - make sure it shows as connected
2. Restart Claude completely (Cmd+Q, then reopen)
3. Try the test again

### No permission prompts appeared
**Problem:** You didn't see the permission dialogs during installation

**Solution:**
1. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security**
2. Click **"Contacts"** on the left
3. Make sure **Claude** and **Terminal** are both enabled
4. If they're not there, click the **+** button to add them
5. Restart Claude

### "Permission denied" or "Access not allowed" errors
**Problem:** Claude doesn't have the right permissions

**Solution:**
1. Go to **System Settings > Privacy & Security > Full Disk Access**
2. Find **Claude** in the list and make sure it's enabled
3. If not there, click **+** and add Claude
4. Go to **Privacy & Security > Contacts**
5. Make sure both **Claude** and **Terminal** are enabled
6. Restart Claude

### Tool shows but doesn't work / returns empty results
**Problem:** Extension is installed but searches return nothing

**Solutions:**
1. **Disable the native contact search** to prevent conflicts:
   - Go to Claude settings â†’ Extensions
   - Find any native "Contact Search" or similar tools
   - Turn them OFF or disable them
   - This prevents Claude from trying the broken native tool first
2. Make sure your Contacts app works normally (open it and verify your contacts are there)
3. Try searching for a contact you know exists
4. Check if search term is spelled correctly
5. Try simpler searches like just first names

### Found wrong contact or multiple matches
**Problem:** Claude finds a contact but it's the wrong person (e.g., "John Smith" instead of "John F. Smith")

**Solutions:**
1. **Be more specific** in your search:
   - Use full names: "John Francis Smith" instead of "John"
   - Include middle names or nicknames if they're in your contacts
   - Add distinguishing info: "John from work" if that's in the contact name
2. **Check for duplicate contacts** in your Contacts app and merge them
3. **Use unique parts of the name** that only one person has
4. **Include phone number or email** in your request: "Text John at 555-1234"

### Contacts with special characters or profanity
**Problem:** Contact names with unusual characters don't work properly

**Solution:**
- The tool handles most special characters fine (tested with "Sean Fucking Nugent")
- If having issues, try searching with just part of the name
- Check that the contact name in Contacts app matches what you're searching for

### Phone number format issues
**Problem:** Phone numbers appear in different formats (+1, parentheses, etc.)

**Note:**
- This is normal - the tool returns numbers exactly as stored in Contacts app
- iMessage will handle different formats automatically
- If messaging fails, check the contact in Contacts app for the correct number

### MCP server gets stuck or stops working
**Problem:** Tool was working but suddenly stops responding

**Solutions:**
1. **Restart Claude completely** (Cmd+Q, then reopen)
2. **Check Activity Monitor** for stuck "node" processes and quit them
3. **Reinstall the extension** if restarting doesn't help

### Extension appears disconnected in Claude
**Problem:** Shows as "disconnected" or "error" in extensions menu

**Solutions:**
1. Remove the extension completely
2. Restart Claude
3. Install again (follow all permission prompts)
4. If still failing, restart your Mac and try again
